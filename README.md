#  APMG open science 
This 'dummy' repository serves to provide some ideas on how to setup an open science paper. The current repository is 'self-contained' (contains publication+data retrieval methods+ scripts). But variations are very well possible and encouraged (e.g. splitting of a part of the software which is also used in other projects/publications)

## Purpose 1. use git for versioning

## Purpose 2. provide unambigous ways for data retrieval

## Purpose 3. Bundle scripts/software which is used to build the results and figures of the paper
